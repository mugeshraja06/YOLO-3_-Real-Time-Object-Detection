Objective:
We have chosen the Coco dataset from 2014 and 2017 which would cover 80 unique
objects that would come under 12 different super-category. Our ultimate goal is to build the Realtime object detector to detect and assign labels for the object form real-time input.

Outcome: 
We were able to build the Real-time object detector and able to assign the label for the
object from the real-time input.
